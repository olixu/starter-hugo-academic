abstract: This article studies the pump scheduling optimization problem in water distribution networks (WDNs) through a novel algorithm that combines knowledge learning and deep reinforcement learning. The optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process by taking three objectives in pressure management into consideration. Knowledge-assisted learning is incorporated into the reinforcement learning framework (KA-RL) to help evaluate the state value and guide the design of reward function, since the proposed KA-RL framework leverages the notion that historical data of WDNs could be utilized to produce optimal trajectories with respect to parametric variations. The knowledge-assisted proximal policy optimization (KA-PPO) algorithm, which only uses nodal pressure data, is proposed based on the KA-RL framework to address the arbitrary WDN topology and time-varying water demand. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by virtue of the 22-node network with two pumps in a pump station. Empirical results demonstrate that KA-PPO works well in practice and compares favorably to Nelderâ€“Mead method.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this article, we have proposed a DRL-based method for scheduling optimization of pumps in WDNs in a time-varying water demand condition. To help terminate the training process and design the reward function, we have established the KA-RL learning framework by combing knowledge-assisted learning with the DRL. Besides, a new algorithm called KA-PPO is proposed. The predictor is used in the KA learning for calculating the best state value of the WDNs.
